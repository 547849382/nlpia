# NLP Data (Corpora, Lexica)

Corpora are collections of documents like conversation transcripts, books, e-mails, tweets, etc. The most valuable corpora have labels for things like the syntax tree, parts of speech, sentiment, "in-reply-to" (for dialog), number of favorites (for tweets) etc

Lexica are collections of words like dictionaries, thesauruses, N-gram collections, or vocabularies (lists of words)
