:part: 1

Part One kicks off your Natural Language Processing (NLP) adventure with an introduction to some real-world applications.
In _The Language of Thought_ you'll quickly begin to think of ways you can use machines that process words in your own life.
And hopefully you'll get a sense for the magic, the power of machines that can glean information from the words in a natural language document.

Words are the foundation of any language, whether it's the keywords in a programming language or the natural language words you learned as a child.
In _Build Your Vocabulary_  we'll give you the tools you need to teach machines to extract words from documents.
There's more to it than you might guess, and we'll show you all the tricks.
You will learn how to automatically group natural language words together into groups of words that share similar spelling, and hopefully similar meaning.

In _Math with Words_ we'll count those words and assemble them into vectors that represent the meaning of a document.
You can use these word count (frequency) vectors to compute the approximate meaning of an entire document, whether it's a 140-character tweet or a 500-page novel.
Finally, in Chapter 4, _Finding Meaning in Word Counts_, you'll discover some time-tested math tricks to compress your vectors down to much more useful topic vectors.

By the end of Part One you'll have the tools you need for many interesting NLP applications -- from semantic search to chatbots.
